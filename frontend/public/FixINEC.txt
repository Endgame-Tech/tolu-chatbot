Executive Summary
Nigeria’s electoral process has struggled with systemic failures that have eroded public trust and democratic integrity. The 2023 elections highlighted enduring issues such as voter disenfranchisement, logistical inefficiencies, and malfunctioning electoral technologies. This report, Part III, transitions from identifying these problems to presenting actionable reforms necessary to transform Nigeria’s electoral system.

Purpose of the Roadmap

3. Provide a sequence of reforms to ensure structured implementation.
